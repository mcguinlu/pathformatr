## Installation

``` {r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("mcguinlu/pathformatr")
library(pathformatr)
```

## Functionality

The purpose of `pathformatr` is singular and simple - to allow you to use the RStudio file path auto-complete functionality in `here()` and `file.path()` calls and then quickly reformat the resulting file path to use quoted, comma-separated elements:

``` {r, eval = FALSE} 
here::here("data/2020/06/01/data.csv")
# or
here::here("data\2020\06\01\data.csv")

# becomes

here::here("data", "2020", "06", "01", "data.csv")
```

This functionality is available via the `format_path()` function, but is designed to work best via an RStudio AddIn - simply highlight your entire function call (i.e. "here(" to ")" inclusive)^[This is to prevent users (mainly me) from reformatting paths in functions that do not support separator-agnostic file paths.], browse to the `pathformatr` section in the RStudio Addins drop-down menu, and select "Split file path into quoted and comma-separated elements.".

Alternatively you can [bind the functionality to a keyboard shortcut](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/206382178-Customizing-Keyboard-Shortcuts) (I personally like mapping it to `CRTL+/`).

A second helper function (`format_all_paths()`) formats all `here()` and `file.path()` calls in the active file, while also allowing users to define additional function calls to target using the `fns` argument.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Open the document in RStudio and then run the following from the console
format_all_paths()

# To only target here() calls
format_all_paths(fns = c("here"))

# To only target file.path() calls
format_all_paths(fns = c("file.path"))
```

## Motivation

My primary motivation for this project was to make it as easy as possible to use the here::here() workflow (the benefits of which are laid out in a [README](https://github.com/jennybc/here_here) by @jennybc). This package/AddIn was created to address my sole issue with `here()`, in that its a pain to format auto-completed file paths by manually going from a slash-separated string to quoted, comma-separated elements.

In addition, this project presented a good opportunity to explore three topics I was keen to expand my knowledge of:

  * the RStudio interface (accessed via the `rstudioapi` package), in particular developing tests for functions that modify user-highlighted text/the active file;
  * building RStudio AddIns; and
  * `regex` syntax, particularly around the handling of slashes ("\\" and "/").
